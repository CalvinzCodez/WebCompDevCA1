# Web Component Development Project Year 4 Semester 1
App created using react that allows a user to log-in to the system as either an administrator or staff. Staff can log-in and place an order whereas the administrator can edit/delete/add menu items.

## Description/Intrusctions
The screen images below give a suggested interface for a small restaurant. Once a staff member has logged into the system (fig.1 ) they may take orders. When logged as an administrator, food items can be added or removed from the restaurant menu. The restaurant selection menus (fig. 2) includes hot drinks, food and cold drinks(water/ cans). The selection of menu item requires going to a specific screen that shows all the possible hot drinks(fig. 3), food or cold drink options in that section. At each menu screen, the user may order one or more items from a particular menu and they may also order different item quantities. E.g they may order two coffees and one tea.  
On completion of the order the user selects ‘check out’ to get the order number and order details as shown in fig. 4.  
 
For the creation of this system, you are asked to use React to create the necessary UI components. 
The images shown represent a possible way to present the restaurant menu. As the developer you are free to change UI presentation.
